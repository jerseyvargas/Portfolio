            <p id="my_description">Hello! I am a product and graphic designer 
                passionate about creating engaging  graphics and empathetic experiences.
                 At the core of my practice is a commitment to understanding and addressing
                the needs of users, particularly those from underrepresented or underserved communities.<br>
                I approach design as a way to bridge gaps, combining empathy, creativity, 
                and research to craft solutions that truly resonate.<br><br>
            <i>Happy to connect with employers and mentors who share a passion for design and innovation!</i></p>

            <p id="rec_details">I had the opportunity to work with Jersey as a part of the app development team for Stone Dry through Develop for Good, and she was a key contributor 
                to the project’s success! She handled tight timelines with professionalism, consistently delivering high-quality work while maintaining a positive
                attitude—even when responses weren’t always as quick as they could have been from me. Jersey communicated clearly and effectively, making sure 
                expectations and needs were understood. She put in extra time to ensure her designs were thoughtful and well-executed, demonstrating a strong work 
                ethic and attention to detail. Her ability to stay focused under pressure, adapt as needed, and produce excellent work makes her a great asset to any team. I highly recommend her!</p>

        <p>Russell Babcock <br> (Junior Year Mentor)</p>
        <p id="rec_details">I had the privilege to mentor Jersey during her junior year at Tufts University. She is a creative and aspiring graphic designer
            whose skills with HTML, Figma, and Adobe Illustrator enable her to turn abstract concepts and ideas into impactful visuals.
            <br><br>Jersey is refreshingly curious, innovative, versatile, receptive to positive and constructive feedback, and willing to try
            new and exciting things. She is a continuous learner who earned several credentials while managing a full course load and working part-time.
            <br><br>Jersey is also a good listener, an effective communicator, and passionate about creating empathetic and immersive graphics and experiences.
            She possesses a deep understanding of design principles, including a good eye for using typography and color effectively, and a strong attention
            to detail.<br><br>I highly recommend Jersey to any organization that needs a graphic designer who will thrive in a fast-paced and collaborative
            environment while creating compelling, eye-catching, and innovative designs for printed materials and digital media.</p>
