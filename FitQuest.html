                Our team was challenged to develop an interface that can solve a problem centering fitness. We spoke about our own journeys with fitness, with some team members pointing out that going to the gym can be an intimidating experience. With that, we sought to understand how we can make this experience more approachable for people in our age group.

    <p id="headlines">The value of asking open ended questions.</p>
    <p>Incorporating open-ended questions could have significantly enhanced the depth and quality of my team’s research. These types of questions encourage interviewees to share more detailed and meaningful insights, providing a richer understanding of their perspectives and experiences which could leverage our research process.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="headlines">Simple wireframing is the way to go when it comes to user testing and iterations. </p>
    <p>During our wireframing phase, we received feedback from our professor that our user testing process could have been more effective if we simplified the design of our low fidelity wireframes to a greater degree. A design choice such as this one could have given my team and I flexibility during testing by allowing user testers the chance to make edits or pinpoint areas where our designs could be improved or better clarified.</p>
