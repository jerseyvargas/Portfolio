                    Individuals seeking community support in their sobriety journey often face friction when engaging with Stone Dry due to fragmented communication across multiple third-party platforms.

    <p id="stage_title_ux" style="color:#64765D">TESTIMONIES FROM TEAM & CLIENT</p>
    <p id="SD_testimony">"Jersey spearheaded the research, design creation, and finalization of the Resource Hub feature of the app, which was one of the client's primary features as it housed additional sobriety resources for users to access such as articles, podcasts, support organizations, and crisis hotline numbers. Jersey's attention to detail, wire-framing skills, and organizational skills shone through this process as there was much information to sort through and many wireframe iterations with the client. Overall, Jersey has great ability to effectively translate complex information into intuitive human-centered designs and Jersey would be a great asset to any team!" <br><br>- Catherine Calangian (Product Manager)</p>
    <p id="SD_testimony2">"I had the opportunity to work with Jersey as a part of the app development team for Stone Dry through Develop for Good, and she was a key contributor to the project&#39;s success! She handled tight timelines with professionalism, consistently delivering high-quality work while maintaining a positive attitude—even when responses weren&#39;t always as quick as they could have been from me. Jersey communicated clearly and effectively, making sure expectations and needs were understood. She put in extra time to ensure her designs were thoughtful and well-executed, demonstrating a strong work ethic and attention to detail. Her ability to stay focused under pressure, adapt as needed, and produce excellent work makes her a great asset to any team. I highly recommend her!" <br><br>- Stephanie Nashert (Client)</p>

        <img id="team"src="assets/stonedry_team1.jpg">
        <p>My time with DFG and The Stone Dry Team was truly a rewarding and invaluable experience crucial to my growth as a product designer. I learned so much from my talented team and gained the skills necessary towards working through design challenges and communicating effectively with clients. Working with the Stone Dry Company was also a pleasant experience as our client's attentiveness and flexibility in meeting our requests helped propel us into creating a successful product. I can't wait to see how this app supports Stone Dry's community once it launches!</p>

    <p id="stage_title_ux" style="color:#64765D">WHAT I LEARNT</p>
    <p id="headlines">Seek Feedback Often</p>
    <p>This was my first time designing a product that would be handed off to a development team, so I made it a priority to ensure my designs were consistent and production-ready. I iterated frequently and regularly checked in with my product manager to make sure my decisions aligned with the broader product vision. These check-ins helped me better understand how to structure information hierarchy and communicate design intent more clearly.</p>
    <p id="headlines">UI Consistency is a team responsibility</p>
    <p>While designing the resources page, I noticed that a "Save" button was a necessary and intuitive feature. However, when reviewing the event creation interface being developed by another team member, I realized this functionality hadn’t been included. I brought up this concern with the team, and together we addressed the inconsistency before handoff. This experience reinforced the value of cross-team communication and attention to shared design patterns.</p>
